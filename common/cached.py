""" Modified Singleton, where there can exist several objects of one class, but 'objects' with same
parameters should link to the one real singleton-like object.
This example based on a recipe 9.13 from D.Beazley "Python Cookbook, 3rd Edition"
Basic usage of metaclasses is more described in protocol_example.py
